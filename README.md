### Hello
I do things, such as code (I think?)

Languages i know:
  - Python (About 1 year of experience)
  - C# (Still learning, couple weeks or a months of experience)
  - C++
  
 The Non-Language Languages I know:
  - HTML (Not much experience, enough to use bootstrap.)
  - CSS (Same thing here)

My main language is python (I know, i'm sorry), though i plan on to learn other languages.
I mostly stuck to python, because i didn't have a need to go to other languages. Python gave me everything i needed,
but then I decided It's unity time.

Languages i want to learn:
  - Java
  - C++
  - C
  - JavaScript
  - PHP (Maybe?)

k thx bai
